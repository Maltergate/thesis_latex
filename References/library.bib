  abstract = {Visually guided robotic capturing of a moving object often requires long-term prediction of the object motion not only for a smooth capture but because visual feedback may not be continually available, e.g., due to vision obstruction by the robotic arm, as well. This paper presents a combined prediction and motionplanning scheme for robotic capturing of a drifting and tumbling object with unknown dynamics using visual feedback. A Kalman filter estimates the states and a set of dynamics parameters of the object needed for long-term prediction of the motion from noisy measurements of a vision system. Subsequently, the estimated states, parameters, and predicted motion trajectories are used to plan the trajectory of the robot's end-effector to intercept a grapple fixture on the object with zero relative velocity (to avoid impact) in an optimal way. The optimal trajectory minimizes a cost function, which is a weighted linear sum of travel time, distance, cosine of a line-of-sight angle (object alignment for robotic grasping), and a penalty function acting as a constraint on acceleration magnitude. Experiments are presented to demonstrate the robot-motion planning scheme for autonomous grasping of a tumbling satellite. Two robotics manipulators are employed: One arm drifts and tumbles the mockup of a satellite, and the other arm that is equipped with a robotic hand tries to capture a grapple fixture on the satellite using the visual guidance system.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a fault-tolerant method for pose estimation of space objects using 3-D vision data by integration of a Kalman filter (KF) and an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm in a closed-loop configuration. The initial guess for the internal ICP iteration is provided by state estimate propagation of the Kalman filer. The Kalman filter is capable of not only estimating the target's states, but also its inertial parameters. This allows the motion of target to be predictable as soon as the filter converges. Consequently, the ICP can maintain pose tracking over a wider range of velocity due to increased precision of ICP initialization. Furthermore, incorporation of the target's dynamics model in the estimation process allows the estimator continuously provide pose estimation even when the sensor temporally loses its signal namely due to obstruction. The capabilities of the pose estimation methodology is demonstrated by a ground testbed for Automated Rendezvous \& Docking (AR\&D). In this experiment, Neptec's Laser Camera System (LCS) is used for real-time scanning of a satellite model attached to a manipulator arm, which is driven by a simulator according to orbital and attitude dynamics. The results showed that robust tracking of the free-floating tumbling satellite can be achieved only if the Kalman filter and ICP are in closed-loop configuration.},

  abstract = {Robotic systems often operate with uncertainties in their dynamics, for example, unknown inertial properties. Broadly, there are two approaches for controlling uncertain systems: design robust controllers in spite of uncertainty, or characterize a system before attempting to control it. This paper proposes a middle-ground approach, making trajectory progress while also accounting for gaining information about the system. More specifically, it combines excitation trajectories which are usually intended to optimize information gain for an estimator, with goal-driven trajectory optimization metrics. For this purpose, a measure of information gain is incorporated (using the Fisher Information Matrix) in a real-time planning framework to produce trajectories favorable for estimation. At the same time, the planner receives stable parameter updates from the estimator, enhancing the system model. An implementation of this learn-as-yougo approach utilizing a Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Nonlinear Model Predictive Controler (NMPC) is demonstrated in simulation. Results for cases with and without information gain and online parameter updates in the system model are presented.},

For improved robustness, temporal consistency of translational and rotational camera velocity is often assumed by propagating motion information forward using stochastic filters. Classical stochastic filters, however, use linear approximations for the non-linear observer model and for the non-linear structure of the underlying Lie Group SE3 and have to approximate the unknown posteriori distribution. In this paper we employ a non-linear measurement model for the camera motion estimation problem that incorporates multiple observation equations. We solve the underlying filtering problem using a novel Minimum Energy Filter on SE3 and give explicit expressions for the optimal state variables. Experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark show that, although a simple motion model is only employed, our approach improves rotational velocity estimation and otherwise is on par with the state-of-the-art.},

Most of existing filtering and data fusion methods that have been applied to the problem of attitude estimation with use of low-cost MEMS-based INS fail in cases that have highly nonlinear process dynamics, nonlinear measurement models, and long-range navigation. This paper presents two nonlinear filtering algorithms for low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) attitude and measurement biases estimation. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Minimum Energy Kalman Filter (MEKF) are designed using two different attitude parameterizations i.e. Euler Angle (EA) and Unit Quaternion (UQ). The two filters AE-UKF and UQ-MEKF use highly nonlinear process and measurements estimators, zero-mean Gaussian noises, and first-order Gauss-Markov biases models. Field experiments, adding systems, and data fusion algorithms are used to achieve real-time tracking and estimation. The results show that both AE-UKF and UQ-MEKF demonstrate high accuracy estimation and robustness for UAVs attitude as well as MEMS biases filtering.},

For this purpose, a square approximation of the search range to suppress irrelevant points is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the ANMS. To further speed up the proposed approaches, we also introduce a novel strategy to initialize the search range based on image dimension which leads to a faster convergence. An exhaustive survey and comparisons with already existing methods are provided to highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our methods and the initialization strategy.},

Then, we review the recently introduced notion of group affine systems on Lie groups. For those systems, we discuss how using the machinery of Harris chains, (almost) globally convergent deterministic observers might be shown to possess stochastic properties in the presence of noise. We also discuss the design of (invariant) extended Kalman filters (IEKF), and we recall the main result, i.e., the Riccati equation computed by the filter to tune its gains has the remarkable property that the Jacobians (A,C) with respect to the system's dynamics and output map are independent of the followed trajectory, whereas the noise covariance matrices that appear in the Riccati equation may depend on the followed trajectory. Owing to this partial independence, some local deterministic convergence properties of the IEKF for group-affine systems on Lie groups may be proved under standard observability conditions.},

  title = {Second {{Order Minimum Energy Filtering}} of {{Joint Variational Camera Motion}} and {{Depth Map Reconstructions}}},
  author = {Berger, Johannes Peter},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Camera motion estimation and dense scene reconstruction are essential for modern computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, robot navigation and virtual reality. State-of-the-art methods are usually based on stereo camera systems that use the information about the distance between the two cameras to uniquely estimate the depth map. However, these systems need to be calibrated and are too expensive for some special industrial applications. Thus, we focus in this work on monocular camera systems that consist of a single moving camera. To increase the robustness of the method we use temporal information in terms of filters. These use temporal consistency to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the current state of a system, e.g. the unknown camera motion or the depth map. Instead of using established stochastic filters such as extended Kalman filters, unscented Kalman filters or particle filters we use novel minimum energy filters that do not base on a stochastic model but on the minimization of an energy function. In a first step we derive the minimum energy filter and provide differential equations for the optimal state and the corresponding second-order operator. We demonstrate that this filter is as exact as state-of-the-art stochastic filters for most problems and, in addition to it, superior in more involved scenarios. Then we consider a simple geometric setting for the reconstruction of the camera motion within a static scene based on stereo image data. There we formulate a non-linear filtering problem on the special Euclidean group based on non-linear observations of optical flow and depth map. In experiments we show that the underlying camera motion can be reconstructed with minimum energy filters as accurate as in other state-of-the-art stereo methods. Finally, we present an approach for the joint reconstruction of camera motion and disparity map (inverse of depth map) in a monocular approach by means of minimum energy filters. By introducing a novel disparity group we can derive the filter without additional constraints or barrier functions. Further we generalize the used energy function to a Charbonnier penalty function which is robuster against outliers in the optical flow. We also demonstrate that additional regularizers can be easily integrated within the overall filtering problem providing a rich basis for many applications. From the mathematical point of view we solve by means of minimum energy filters a non-linear filtering problem on a Lie group for a high dimensional problem -- thus a problem which is infeasible for most stochastic filter},

  abstract = {Accurate camera motion estimation is a fundamental building block for many Computer Vision algorithms. For improved robustness, temporal consistency of translational and rotational camera velocity is often assumed by propagating motion information forward using stochastic filters. Classical stochastic filters, however, use linear approximations for the non-linear observer model and for the non-linear structure of the underlying Lie Group SE3 and have to approximate the unknown posteriori distribution. In this paper we employ a non-linear measurement model for the camera motion estimation problem that incorporates multiple observation equations. We solve the underlying filtering problem using a novel Minimum Energy Filter on SE3 and give explicit expressions for the optimal state variables. Experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark show that, although a simple motion model is only employed, our approach improves rotational velocity estimation and otherwise is on par with the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {Feature matching aims at generating correspondences across images, which is widely used in many computer vision tasks. Although considerable progress has been made on feature descriptors and fast matching for initial correspondence hypotheses, selecting good ones from them is still challenging and critical to the overall performance. More importantly, existing methods often take a long computational time, limiting their use in real-time applications. This paper attempts to separate true correspondences from false ones at high speed. We term the proposed method (GMS) grid-based motion Statistics, which incorporates the smoothness constraint into a statistic framework for separation and uses a grid-based implementation for fast calculation. GMS is robust to various challenging image changes, involving in viewpoint, scale, and rotation. It is also fast, e.g., take only 1 or 2 ms in a single CPU thread, even when 50K correspondences are processed. This has important implications for real-time applications. What's more, we show that incorporating GMS into the classic feature matching and epipolar geometry estimation pipeline can significantly boost the overall performance. Finally, we integrate GMS into the well-known ORB-SLAM system for monocular initialization, resulting in a significant improvement.},

Since this kind of operations involves the capture of the debris, the accurate knowledge of the position of their center of mass is a fundamental safety requirement. As ground observations are not sufficient to reach the required accuracy level, this information should be acquired in situ just before any contact between the chaser and the target. Some estimation methods in the literature rely on the usage of stereo cameras for tracking several features of the target surface. The actual positions of these features are estimated together with the location of the center of mass by state observers. The principal drawback of these methods is related to possible sudden disappearances of one or more features from the field of view of the cameras. An alternative method based on 3D Kinematic registration is presented in this paper. The method, which does not suffer of the mentioned drawback, considers a preliminary reduction of the inaccuracies in detecting features by the usage of statistical shape analysis.},

Finally, for the approaches dealing with unknown objects, the core part is the extraction of specific features that are indicative of good grasps.

In this paper we propose a novel approach to 3D uncertainty of ICP that accounts for all the sources of error as listed in Censi's pioneering work [1], namely wrong convergence, underconstrained situations, and sensor noise. Our approach builds on two facts. First, the uncertainty about the ICP's output fully depends on the initialization accuracy. Thus speaking of the covariance of ICP makes sense only in relation to the initialization uncertainty, which generally stems from odometry errors. We capture this using the unscented transform, which also reflects correlations between initial and final uncertainties. Then, assuming white sensor noise leads to overoptimism as ICP is biased owing to e.g. calibration biases, which we account for. Our solution is tested on publicly available real data ranging from structured to unstructured environments, where our algorithm predicts consistent results with actual uncertainty, and compares favorably to previous methods.},

  abstract = {Vision-based methods to determine the relative pose of an uncooperative orbiting object are investigated in applications to spacecraft proximity operations, such as on-orbit servicing, spacecraft formation flying, and small bodies exploration. Depending on whether the object is known or unknown, a shape model of the orbiting target object may have to be constructed autonomously in real-time by making use of only optical measurements. The Simultaneous Estimation of Pose and Shape (SEPS) algorithm that does not require a priori knowledge of the pose and shape of the target is presented. This makes use of a novel measurement equation and filter that can efficiently use optical flow information along with a star tracker to estimate the target's angular rotational and translational relative velocity as well as its center of gravity. Depending on the mission constraints, SEPS can be augmented by a more accurate offline, on-board 3D reconstruction of the target shape, which allows for the estimation of the pose as a known target. The use of Structure from Motion (SfM) for this purpose is discussed. A model-based approach for pose estimation of known targets is also presented. The architecture and implementation of both the proposed approaches are elucidated and their performance metrics are evaluated through numerical simulations by using a dataset of images that are synthetically generated according to a chaser/target relative motion in Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO).},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a new state estimation algorithm called the extended information filter on Lie groups. The proposed filter is inspired by the extended Kalman filter on Lie groups and exhibits the advantages of the information filter with regard to multisensor update and decentralization, while keeping the accuracy of stochastic inference on Lie groups. We present the theoretical development and demonstrate its performance on multisensor rigid body attitude tracking by forming the state space on the SO(3) \texttimes{} R3 group, where the first and second component represent the orientation and angular rates, respectively. The performance of the filter is compared with respect to the accuracy of attitude tracking with parametrization based on Euler angles and with respect to execution time of the extended Kalman filter formulation on Lie groups. The results show that the filter achieves higher performance consistency and smaller error by tracking the state directly on the Lie group and that it keeps smaller computational complexity of the information form with respect to high number of measurements.},

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

However, significant time and effort is frequently required to tune various Kalman filter model parameters, e.g. process noise covariance, pre-whitening filter models for non-white noise, etc. Conventional optimization techniques for tuning can get stuck in poor local minima and can be expensive to implement with real sensor data. To address these issues, a new ``black box'' Bayesian optimization strategy is developed for automatically tuning Kalman filters. In this approach, performance is characterized by one of two stochastic objective functions: normalized estimation error squared (NEES) when ground truth state models are available, or the normalized innovation error squared (NIS) when only sensor data is available. By intelligently sampling the parameter space to both learn and exploit a nonparametric Gaussian process surrogate function for the NEES/NIS costs, Bayesian optimization can efficiently identify multiple local minima and provide uncertainty quantification on its results.},

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional spatial propagation network (CSPN) to learn the affinity matrix for depth prediction. Specifically, we adopt an efficient linear propagation model, where the propagation is performed with a manner of recurrent convolutional operation, and the affinity among neighboring pixels is learned through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We apply the designed CSPN to two depth estimation tasks given a single image: (1) Refine the depth output from existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods; (2) Convert sparse depth samples to a dense depth map by embedding the depth samples within the propagation procedure. The second task is inspired by the availability of LiDAR that provides sparse but accurate depth measurements. We experimented the proposed CSPN over the popular NYU v2 [1] and KITTI [2] datasets, where we show that our proposed approach improves not only quality (e.g., 30\% more reduction in depth error), but also speed (e.g., 2 to 5\texttimes{} faster) of depth maps than previous SOTA methods.},

The constraints associated with small celestial body missions require high precision navigation systems which cannot solely rely upon conventional inertial sensing techniques due to the lack of a gravity field of SCB's. Thus, visual navigation techniques become a valuable alternative despite their heavy computational burden. Combining visual linear pose estimation techniques with inertial motion estimates, this work presents a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (RBPFSLAM) algorithm that aims at estimating the position and attitude - or pose - of a spacecraft maneuvering near a SCB. The RBPF SLAM uses visual signatures to recognize landmarks on the surface and triangulate its position with respect to it. The performance and limitations of this approach are presented through a sensitivity analysis.},

This scheme combines monocular visual odometry with a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system. The SLAM uses octree occupancy grids to store observed landmarks, mapping the topography of the asteroid while providing inertial data to the spacecraft's position and attitude controller. The approach, descent and landing scheme used in this work ensures that the spacecraft will complete at least one rotation around the asteroid over the course of the landing phase, guaranteeing loop closure of the SLAM algorithm, justifying the extra computational cost of this high-precision landing scheme.},

  author = {Cropp, Alexander},
  year = {2001},
  abstract = {A method of estimating the relative position and orientation of a known target satellite is presented, using only passive imagery. Such a method is intended as a prelude to a system required in future autonomous satellite docking missions. Using a single monocular image, and utilising knowledge of the target spacecraft, estimation of the target's six relative rotation and translation parameters with respect to the camera are found. Pose estimation is divided into modular sections. Each frame is processed to detect the major lines in the image, and correspondence information between detected lines and a-priori target information is estimated, resulting in a list of line-to-model correspondences. This correspondence information is used to estimate the pose of the target required to produce such a correspondence list. Multiple possible pose estimates are generated and tested, where each estimate contains the three rotation and translation parameters. The best estimates go through to the least-squares minimisation phase, which reduces estimation error and provides statistical information for multi-frame filtering. The final estimate vector and covariance matrix is the end result for each frame. Estimates of the target location over time allow the relative orbit parameters of the target to be estimated. Location estimates are filtered to fit an orbit model based on Hill's Equations, and statistical information gathered with each estimate is including in the filter process when estimating the orbit parameters. These orbit parameters allow prediction of the target location with time, which will enable mission planning and safety analysis of potential orbit manoeuvres in close proximity to the target. Testing is carried out by a detailed simulation system, which renders accurate images of the target satellite given the true pose of the target with respect to the inertial reference frame. The rendering software used takes into account lighting conditions, reflections, shadowing, specularity, and other considerations, and further post-processing is involved to produce a realistic image. Target position over time is modelled on orbit dynamics with respect to a defined inertial frame. Transformation between inertial, target, and camera frames of reference are dealt with, to transform a rotating target in the inertial frame to the apparent rotation in the camera frame.},

XSS-1O was a 28kilogram micro-satellite was launched as a secondary mission on a Delta II expendable launch vehicle carrying a GPS satellite. XSS-1O was equipped with a visible camera, a star sensor, and mini SGLS system, all specially built for this program. In addition, a visible camera was attached to the second stage to observe the release of the micro-satellite and observe its maneuvers. Following the release of the GPS satellite, the Delta II initiated three depletion burns to reorient into an 800 KM circular orbit. The XSS-1O was ejected from the Delta II second stage approximately 18 hours after launch. Operating autonomously on a preplanned course, XSS-1O performed its mission of navigating around the Delta II second stage at preplanned positions; the micro-satellite took images of the second stage and send them back to earth in real time. During these demonstrations the XSS-1O mission operations team accomplished responsive checkout of the micro-satellite and all of its subsystems, autonomous navigation on a preplanned course and a variety of algorithms and mission operations that pave the way for more ambitious missions in the future.

In addition, in an indirect but dramatic way, column ordering heuristics automatically exploit the locality inherent in the geographic nature of the SLAM problem. This paper presents the theory underlying these methods, along with an interpretation of factorization in terms of the graphical model associated with the SLAM problem. Both simulation results and actual SLAM experiments in large-scale environments are presented that underscore the potential of these methods as an alternative to EKF-based approaches.},

A first session in October 2011 addressed two objectives: 1) demonstrate angles-only navigation to rendezvous with a non-cooperative object; 2) exercise transitions between RF-based and vision-based control during final formation acquisition. A complementary experiment in September 2012 mimicked some future astrometry mission and implemented the manoeuvres required to point the two satellite axis to a celestial target and maintain it fixed during some observation period. In the first sections, the paper presents the experiment motivations, describes its main design features including the guidance and control algorithms evolutions and provides a synthesis of the most significant results along with a discussion of the lessons learned. In the last part, the paper evokes the applicability of these experiment results to some active debris removal mission concept that is currently being studied.},

The extracted points are ``SLAM-ready'' because they are by design isolated and well-distributed throughout the image. We compare this network against classical point detectors and discover a significant performance gap in the presence of image noise. As transformation estimation is more simple when the detected points are geometrically stable, we designed a second network, MagicWarp, which operates on pairs of point images (outputs of MagicPoint), and estimates the homography that relates the inputs. This transformation engine differs from traditional approaches because it does not use local point descriptors, only point locations. Both networks are trained with simple synthetic data, alleviating the requirement of expensive external camera ground truthing and advanced graphics rendering pipelines. The system is fast and lean, easily running 30+ FPS on a single CPU.},

Based on the pose and motion estimates, the desired pose and trajectory of end-effector is defined and the corresponding desired joint angles of the robotic manipulator are derived by inverse kinematics. A close-loop visual servo control scheme is then developed for the robotic manipulator to track, approach and capture the target. Validating experiments are designed and performed on a custom-built six degrees of freedom robotic manipulator with an eye-in-hand configuration.

The modeling and control of such systems are investigated throughout the paper. Dynamic models rely on an adapted Newton\textendash Euler algorithm, and control algorithms are based on the fixed-structure H{$\infty$} synthesis, recently implemented in an efficient Matlab toolbox. The main goal is to efficiently track a target point on the debris while using PDlike controllers to reduce computational burden. The fixedstructure H{$\infty$} framework proves to be a suitable tool to design a reduced-order robust controller that catches up with external disturbances and is simultaneously compatible with current space processors capabilities.},

  author = {Duvenaud, David Kristjanson},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {This thesis develops a method for automatically constructing, visualizing and describ- ing a large class of models, useful for forecasting and finding structure in domains such as time series, geological formations, and physical dynamics. These models, based on Gaussian processes, can capture many types of statistical structure, such as periodicity, changepoints, additivity, and symmetries. Such structure can be encoded through ker- nels, which have historically been hand-chosen by experts. We show how to automate this task, creating a system that explores an open-ended space of models and reports the structures discovered. To automatically construct Gaussian process models, we search over sums and prod- ucts of kernels, maximizing the approximate marginal likelihood. We show how any model in this class can be automatically decomposed into qualitatively different parts, and how each component can be visualized and described through text. We combine these results into a procedure that, given a dataset, automatically constructs a model along with a detailed report containing plots and generated text that illustrate the structure discovered in the data. The introductory chapters contain a tutorial showing how to express many types of structure through kernels, and how adding and multiplying different kernels combines their properties. Examples also show how symmetric kernels can produce priors over topological manifolds such as cylinders, toruses, and M\"obius strips, as well as their higher-dimensional generalizations. This thesis also explores several extensions to Gaussian process models. First, build- ing on existing work that relates Gaussian processes and neural nets, we analyze natural extensions of these models to deep kernels and deep Gaussian processes. Second, we ex- amine additive Gaussian processes, showing their relation to the regularization method of dropout. Third, we combine Gaussian processes with the Dirichlet process to produce the warped mixture model: a Bayesian clustering model having nonparametric cluster shapes, and a corresponding latent space in which each cluster has an interpretable parametric form.},

Rather than dealing with technology issues, however, we deal with issues concerning the potential market (the ``demand'' side) for OOS. We present the case that robotic OOS is not only commercially feasible, but also even more strongly assert that it is essential. We consider in particular the recent high incidence of on-orbit failures in geostationary telecommunications platforms. We present the sobering statistics of such failures, and determine that only OOS can mitigate these and future failures. OOS represents the first space-based commercial opportunity that serves the space industry itself rather than Earth-oriented applications more typical of commercial space activities, and to that end provides the basis for future space infrastructure development.},

Launch traffic into the LEO protected region is changing significantly, fuelled by the proliferation of smallpayloads, i.e. below 10.0 kg in mass, during the last few years in terms of number, but not contributingsignificantly to the mass. Around 78\% of small payloads ,i.e. below 10.0kg in mass, launched during the current decade and injected into the LEO protected region operate in orbits which naturally adhere to the space debris mitigationmeasures. Between 30 and 60\% of all payload mass estimated as reaching end-of-life during the current decade inthe LEO protected region does so in orbits that are estimated to adhere to the space debris mitigationmeasures. Around 70\% of all rocket body mass reaching end-of-life during the current does so in orbits that areestimated to adhere to the space debris mitigation measures on protecting LEOIADC. A significant amountof this is due to controlled re-entries after launch, a practice which is increasing and was above 30\% in2017.

Such a framework is used in view-based representations of the environment that rely upon scan-matching raw sensor data to obtain virtual observations of robot motion with respect to a place it has previously been. The exact sparseness of the delayed-state information matrix is in contrast to other recent feature-based SLAM information algorithms, such as sparse extended information filter or thin junction-tree filter, since these methods have to make approximations in order to force the feature-based SLAM information matrix to be sparse. The benefit of the exact sparsity of the delayed-state framework is that it allows one to take advantage of the information space parameterization without incurring any sparse approximation error. Therefore, it can produce equivalent results to the full-covariance solution. The approach is validated experimentally using monocular imagery for two datasets: a test-tank experiment with ground truth, and a remotely operated vehicle survey of the RMS Titanic},

  abstract = {Space robotics is considered one of the most promising approaches for on-orbit servicing (OOS) missions such as docking, berthing, refueling, repairing, upgrading, transporting, rescuing, and orbital debris removal. Many enabling techniques have been developed in the past two decades and several technology demonstration missions have been completed. A number of manned on-orbit servicing missions were successfully accomplished but unmanned, fully autonomous, servicing missions have not been done yet. Furthermore, all previous unmanned technology demonstration missions were designed to service cooperative targets only. Robotic servicing of a non-cooperative satellite is still an open research area facing many technical challenges. One of the greatest challenges is to ensure the servicing spacecraft safely and reliably docks with the target spacecraft or capture the target to stabilize it for subsequent servicing. This is especially important if the target has an unknown motion and kinematics/ dynamics properties. Obviously, further research and development of the enabling technologies are needed. To motivate and facilitate such research and development, this paper provides a literature review of the recently developed technologies related to the kinematics, dynamics, control and verification of space robotic systems for manned and unmanned on-orbit servicing missions.},

A graphical simulation environment was used to study the job and develop an algorithm which finds the next path for the wheel loader to clear. The algorithm finds both full paths of new material and also paths to clear spillage from previous actions if necessary. Simulations and manually performed outdoor tests showed that it can work for different layer thicknesses, area dimensions and snow properties.

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

To overcome these problems, in this paper, H-infinity UFastSLAM (HUFastSLAM) with evolutionary resampling is proposed. The proposed method can work in unknown statistical noise and does not require a prior knowledge about the of the noise statistics.

The community has made great progress in the last decade by enabling real world solutions and is addressing important challenges in high-level scalability, resources awareness and domain adaptation. A novel adaptive SLAM system is proposed, to accomplish rover navigation and computational demands. It starts from a 3D odometry dead reckoning solution and builds up to a full graph optimization which takes into account rover traction performance. A complete kinematics of the rover locomotion system improves the wheel odometry solution. In addition, an odometry error model is inferred using Gaussian Processes (GPs) in order to predict non-systematic errors induced by poor traction of the rover with the terrain. The non-parametric GP regression serves to adapt the localization and mapping to the current navigation demands (domain adaptation). The method brings scalability and adaptiveness to modern SLAM. Therefore, an adaptive strategy develops in order to adjust the image frame rate (active perception) and to influence the optimization back-end by including high informative keyframes in the graph (adaptive information gain). The work is experimentally verified on a representative planetary rover under a realistic field test scenario. The results show a modern SLAM systems which adapts to the predicted error. The system maintains accuracy with less number of nodes taking the most benefit of both wheel and visual methods in a consistent graph-based smoothing approach.},

Therefore, IMU error modelling and the efficient integration of IMU and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations has remained a challenge. In this paper, we developed deep Kalman filter to model and remove IMU errors and, consequently, improve the accuracy of IMU positioning. To achieve this, we added a modelling step to the prediction and update steps of the Kalman filter, so that the IMU error model is learned during integration. The results showed our deep Kalman filter outperformed the conventional Kalman filter and reached a higher level of accuracy.},

We explore the use of Conjugate Gradients for calculating the Newton step and its performance as a function of some simple and computationally efficient preconditioners. We show that the common Schur complement trick is not limited to factorization-based methods and that it can be interpreted as a form of preconditioning. Using photos from a street-side dataset and several community photo collections, we generate a variety of bundle adjustment problems and use them to evaluate the performance of six different bundle adjustment algorithms. Our experiments show that truncated Newton methods, when paired with relatively simple preconditioners, offer state of the art performance for large-scale bundle adjustment. The code, test problems and detailed performance data are available at http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/bal.},

For example, it is well known that the simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem can be formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and solved using NLS, yielding a mean state vector. However, for many applications recovering only the mean vector is not enough. Data association, active decisions, next best view, are only few of the applications that require fast state covariance recovery. The problem is not simple since, in general, the covariance is obtained by inverting the system matrix and the result is dense.},

Bundle adjustment (BA) and structure from motion (SFM) are techniques used to estimate both the camera poses and the set of sparse points in the environment. Many applications require such reconstruction to be performed online, while acquiring the data, and produce an updated result every step. Furthermore, using active feedback about the quality of the reconstruction can help selecting the best views to increase the accuracy as well as to maintain a reasonable size of the collected data. This paper provides novel and efficient solutions to solving the associated NLS incrementally, and to compute not only the optimal solution, but also the associated uncertainty. The proposed technique highly increases the efficiency of the incremental BA solver for long camera trajectory applications, and provides extremely fast covariance recovery.},

  abstract = {Accurate and detailed 3-dimensional (3D) models of the underwater environment are becoming increasingly important in modern marine surveys, since they convey immense information that can be easily interpreted. Techniques such as bundle adjustment (BA) and structure from motion (SfM), which jointly estimate sparse 3D points of the scene and camera poses, have gained popularity in underwater mapping applications. However, for large-area surveys these methods are computationally expensive and not intended for online application. This paper proposes an SfM pipeline based on solving the BA problem in an incremental and efficient way. Furthermore, the new system can provide not only the solution of the optimization (camera trajectory along time and the 3D points of the environment), but also the estimate of the uncertainty associated with the 3D reconstruction. This system is able to produce results in mission-time, i.e. while the robot is in the water or very shortly afterwards. Such quick availability is of great importance during survey operations as it allows data quality assessment in-situ, and eventual replanning of missions in case of need.},

Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals.},

Also, to enable data association in real time, we provide efficient algorithms to access the estimation uncertainties of interest based on the factored information matrix. We systematically evaluate the different components of iSAM as well as the overall algorithm using various simulated and real-world datasets for both landmark and pose-only settings. \textcopyright{} 2008 IEEE.},

Compared to the exploration of Mars and Moon it poses larger uncertainties in terms of the surface structure and composition as well as risks and challenges due to low gravity.

However, its mobility was feed-forward controlled only and needed excessive simulations and information on the asteroid before the landing to operate sufficiently robust. For future hopping explorers this paper proposes an attitude controller with additional control mechanisms to a) land in a nominal measurement orientation after every hop and b) to diminish kinetic energy in the system as fast as possible to minimize bouncing. This allows the lander to operate for longer periods of time with larger time slots for scientific measurements, also reducing the mission risk due to landing in false orientation.},

In this work, we simultaneously estimate the joint angles of the robot and reconstruct a dense volumetric model of the scene. In this way, we perform simultaneous localization and mapping in the configuration space of the robot, rather than in the pose space of the camera. We show using simulations and robot experiments that our approach greatly reduces both 3-D reconstruction error and joint angle error over simply using the forward kinematics. Unlike other approaches, ours directly reasons about robot joint angles, and can use these to constrain the pose of the sensor. Because of this, it is more robust to missing or ambiguous depth data than approaches that are unconstrained by the robot's kinematics.},

Recently, Gaussian processes have been introduced as a non-parametric technique for learning such models from training data. In the context of unscented Kalman filters, these models have been shown to provide estimates that can be superior to those achieved with standard, parametric models. In this paper we show how Gaussian process models can be integrated into other Bayes filters, namely particle filters and extended Kalman filters. We provide a complexity analysis of these filters and evaluate the alternative techniques using data collected with an autonomous micro-blimp.},

  abstract = {Kalman Filters are one of the most influential models of time-varying phenomena. They admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation, have a simple functional form, and enjoy widespread adoption in a variety of disciplines. Motivated by recent variational methods for learning deep generative models, we introduce a unified algorithm to efficiently learn a broad spectrum of Kalman filters. Of particular interest is the use of temporal generative models for counterfactual inference. We investigate the efficacy of such models for counterfactual inference, and to that end we introduce the ``Healing MNIST'' dataset where long-term structure, noise and actions are applied to sequences of digits. We show the efficacy of our method for modeling this dataset. We further show how our model can be used for counterfactual inference for patients, based on electronic health record data of 8,000 patients over 4.5 years.},

This overcomes serious shortcomings of approaches using a global reference frame to compute the error.

Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods. All the data and experiment codes are available online.},

OSIRIS-REx returns a minimum of 60 g of bulk regolith and a separate 26 cm2 of fine-grained surface material from this body. Analyses of these samples provide unprecedented knowledge about presolar history, from the initial stages of planet formation to the origin of life. Prior to sample acquisition, OSIRIS-REx performs comprehensive global mapping of the texture, mineralogy, and chemistry of Bennu, resolving geological features, revealing its geologic and dynamic history, and providing context for the returned samples. The instruments also document the regolith at the sampling site in situ at scales down to the sub-centimeter. In addition, OSIRIS-REx studies the Yarkovsky effect, a non-Keplerian force affecting the orbit of this potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA), and provides the first ground truth for telescopic observations of carbonaceous asteroids.},

The underlying engine of a SLAM system is its back-end, which aims at optimally estimating the trajectory and map of the environment based on sensor data abstractions. Over the past decade, SLAM solutions based on graph optimization approaches prevailed over the filtering based solutions, since they dominated in performance over a wider range of applications. In this paper we propose a novel filtering based SLAM back-end based on the exactly sparse delayed state filter (ESDSF) derived on Lie groups (LG-ESDSF). The proposed filter retains all the good characteristics of the classic ESDSF, but also respects the state space geometry by employing filtering equations directly on Lie groups. We have compared our SLAM system with two current state-of-the-art SLAM solutions, namely ORB-SLAM and LSD-SLAM, on the KITTI vision benchmark suite. Test results show that the proposed SLAM based on the LG-ESDSF back-end can achieve same level of accuracy as the methods based on the graph optimization techniques, while maintaining lower computation times.},

While historically the problem has been addressed with filtering, advancements in visual estimation suggest that nonlinear optimization offers superior accuracy, while still tractable in complexity thanks to the sparsity of the underlying problem. Taking inspiration from these findings, we formulate a rigorously probabilistic cost function that combines reprojection errors of landmarks and inertial terms. The problem is kept tractable and thus ensuring real-time operation by limiting the optimization to a bounded window of keyframes through marginalization. Keyframes may be spaced in time by arbitrary intervals, while still related by linearized inertial terms. We present evaluation results on complementary datasets recorded with our custom-built stereo visual\textendash inertial hardware that accurately synchronizes accelerometer and gyroscope measurements with imagery. A comparison of both a stereo and monocular version of our algorithm with and without online extrinsics estimation is shown with respect to ground truth. Furthermore, we compare the performance to an implementation of a state-of-the-art stochastic cloning sliding-window filter. This competitive reference implementation performs tightly coupled filtering-based visual\textendash inertial odometry. While our approach declaredly demands more computation, we show its superior performance in terms of accuracy.},

Cumulative ranking of large groups of the LEO debris population and general limitations of passive drag devices and rocket-based removal systems are analyzed. A candidate electrodynamic debris removal system is discussed that can affordably remove all debris objects over 2 kg from LEO in 7 years. That means removing more than 99\% of the collision-generated debris potential in LEO. Removal is performed by a dozen 100-kg propellantless vehicles that react against the Earth's magnetic field. The debris objects are dragged down and released into short-lived orbits below ISS. As an alternative to deorbit, some of them can be collected for storage and possible in-orbit recycling. The estimated cost per kilogram of debris removed is a small fraction of typical launch costs per kilogram. These rates are low enough to open commercial opportunities and create a governing framework for wholesale removal of large debris objects from LEO.},

During the past decades, the Hubble Space Telescope has made great contributions to the fields of astronomy and physics through both observational data and the success of five OOS missions to overcome big challenges. That included an initial flaw of its primary mirror and subsequent obstacles associated with replacing and upgrading its science instruments. Furthermore, many programs have been carried out in the area of the OOS of spacecraft with successful operations in space. It could be exemplified by the assembly of the International Space Station, service verification of ETS-VII and Orbital Express, and detailed research for future applications including servicer and client satellites and particularly large space systems. This paper attempts to summarize all reported programs of the OOS in terms of engineering developments and provide an overall perspective for investigators in this field. Based on the reviewed programs, an analysis is carried out to elucidate the logical architectures of the mission and technology of the OOS of spacecraft. Further attention is paid to discussions of the enabling technologies that support the development of the OOS and related spacecraft. As an outlook, the future development and challenges of the OOS and the application of novel technologies are finally discussed to extend the present review work.},

This has application in many current and projected space missions, such as satellite capture and servicing, debris capture and mitigation, and large space structure assembly and maintenance. The method presented here consists of three distinct parts: (1) kinematic data fusion, which condenses sensory data into a coarse estimate of target pose; (2) Kalman filtering, which filters these coarse estimates and extracts the full dynamic state and inertial parameters of the target; and (3) shape estimation, which uses filtered pose information and the raw sensory data to build a probabilistic map of the target's shape. This method does not rely on feature detection, optical flow, or model matching, and therefore is robust to the harsh sensing conditions of space. Instead, it exploits the well-modeled dynamics of objects in space through the Kalman filter. The architecture is computationally fast since only coarse measurements need to be provided to the Kalman filter. This paper will summarize the three steps of the architecture. Simulation results will follow showing the theoretical performance of the architecture.},

There are, however, monumental technical, resource, operational, legal, and political challenges in making economically viable ADR a reality. Before a consensus on the need for ADR can be reached, a careful analysis of its effectiveness must be conducted. The goal is to demonstrate the need and feasibility of using ADR to better preserve the future environment and to explore different operational options to maximize the benefit-to-cost ratio. This paper describes a new sensitivity study on using ADR to stabilize the future LEO debris environment. The NASA long-term orbital debris evolutionary model, LEGEND, is used to quantify the effects of several key parameters, including target selection criteria/constraints and the starting epoch of ADR implementation. Additional analyses on potential ADR targets among the existing satellites and the benefits of collision avoidance maneuvers are also included.},

This paper does not intend to address the technical or economical issues for active debris removal. Rather, the objective is to provide a sensitivity study to illustrate and quantify the effectiveness of various remediation options. An effective removal criterion based upon mass and collision probability is developed. This study includes simulations with removal rates ranging from 5 to 20 objects per year, starting in the year 2020. The outcome of each simulation is analyzed and compared with others. The summary of the study serves as a general guideline for future debris removal consideration.},

Bundle adjustment involves the formulation of a large scale, yet sparse minimization problem, which is traditionally solved using a sparse variant of the LevenbergMarquardt optimization algorithm that avoids storing and operating on zero entries. This paper argues that considerable computational benefits can be gained by substituting the sparse Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the implementation of bundle adjustment with a sparse variant of Powell's dog leg non-linear least squares technique. Detailed comparative experimental results provide strong evidence supporting this claim.},

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low-residual least-squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially-occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

However, recent concepts of the geometric phase have allowed a new perspective on this classical problem. Here we explicitly use the equations of motion to find a closed form expression for total phase and hence the geometric phase of the force-free asymmetric top and explore some consequences of this formula with the particular example of the spinning handle for demonstration purposes. As one of the simplest dynamical systems, the asymmetric top should be a canonical example to explore the classical analog of Berry phase.},

In this work, we argue that keyframes are not the optimal choice for this task, due to several inherent limitations, such as weak geometric reasoning and poor scalability. We propose a voxel-map representation to efficiently retrieve map points for visual SLAM. In particular, we organize the map points in a regular voxel grid. Visible points from a camera pose are queried by sampling the camera frustum in a raycasting manner, which can be done in constant time using an efficient voxel hashing method. Compared with keyframes, the retrieved points using our method are geometrically guaranteed to fall in the camera field-of-view, and occluded points can be identified and removed to a certain extend. This method also naturally scales up to large scenes and complicated multicamera configurations. Experimental results show that our voxel map representation is as efficient as a keyframe map with 5 keyframes and provides significantly higher localization accuracy (average 46\% improvement in RMSE) on the EuRoC dataset. The proposed voxel-map representation is a general approach to a fundamental functionality in visual SLAM and widely applicable.},

We also perform loop closing (detection + correction), at keyframerate, in loops containing hundreds of keyframes. For both relocalisation and loop closing, we propose a bag of words place recognizer with ORB features, which is able to recognize places spending less than 39 ms, including feature extraction, in databases containing 10K images (without geometrical verification). We evaluate the performance of this recognizer in four different datasets, achieving high recall and no false matches, and getting better results than the state-of-art in place recognition, being one order of magnitude faster.},

Robin took a few minutes to share his lessons learned, joined by Andrew Wolahan, a system engineer for Clean Space who joined the team shortly after Robin. e.Deorbit began life in 2013, inspiring strong passion in all people involved in its conception. The objective was clear: ESA, like all space agencies, had a role to play in cleaning up debris from space. ``It was not a choice, it was a must,'' remarked the then ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain. Doing nothing and letting the problem fester would at some point make it more difficult, and therefore expensive, to do anything in space. So, with the blessing of the Director General and ESA's Director of Technology, Engineering and Quality Franco Ongaro, the e.Deorbit mission took shape. This innovative mission was designed in an innovative way, harnessing model-based system engineering (MBSE) \textendash{} meaning its development was focused on shared software models, rather than written documents. ``We were the first to require the use of MBSE for Phase B1 of the entire mission design,'' explains Robin, ``including the physical architecture of the platform and payload together with the functional and logical architecture of the mission, with direct links to some of the tools used for simulations. Not only did we learn a lot about how to improve design using MBSE, industry really ran with the concept, and are today using it for a variety of other purposes.'' Read `Applying MBSE to a space mission`. The mission itself proved to be feasible, as Robin notes: ``the main challenge is not technical \textendash{} it is to get the money.''

Since 2013, ESA has been working on the e.Deorbit mission, where the goal is to ``Remove a single large ESA-owned Space Debris from the LEO protected zone''. The Active Debris Removal (ADR) mission consists of a satellite (chaser) that is launched by a small or medium launcher, performs a rendezvous with the ESA-owned debris (target), captures via robotic means and removes the target from the LEO protected zone. In parallel to e.Deorbit, European industry has been working on the concept of Space Servicing Vehicles~ (SSVs, otherwise known as Space Tugs); a spacecraft capable of offering on-orbit services such as: On-orbit servicing: Travelling from one spacecraft from another to provide fuel, replace a battery or fix a solar panel Tugging of spacecraft from one region to another: For instance, from low earth orbit to the geostationary orbit, or from Earth orbit to a lunar orbit In-orbit assembly: Placing several parts of a system together, such as attaching an antenna onto a spacecraft in-orbit In 2017, ESA conducted a Pre-Phase A study in ESA's Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) on the Space Servicing Vehicle in support of European Industry. Three mission scenarios were analyzed: Deep Space Gateway (DSG) Tug: To move a payload module ({$>$}5 tons) from LEO to a near-rectilinear orbit and rendezvous and dock with the DSG. GEO Antenna Assembly: To rendezvous and dock with a GEO s/c, than attach large solid antenna modules.

  abstract = {Future Active Debris Removal missions will require an autonomous spacecraft (chaser) to safely monitor at close distance, and then approach and dispose an inactive artificial space object (target). Since these targets are un\- cooperative, meaning that they cannot provide any hint or help to the chaser navigation system, such operations require the target-chaser relative state and the target inertia parameters to be accurately estimated relying only on measurements from active or passive Electro-Optical sensors. In this framework, this paper proposes an original multi-step architecture for the estimation of the relative motion and inertia parameters of an uncoop\- erative target during a close-range monitoring trajectory. In the first phase, LIDAR-based pose measurements and a smoothing approach are used to retrieve accurate, linearly independent estimates of the target angular velocity. These estimates are then used to compute the target's moments of inertia ratios solving a linear system based on the conservation equation for the angular momentum. Once the inertia parameters are accurately estimated, the LIDAR-based pose measurements are used to feed an Unscented Kalman Filter to determine the full relative state according to a loosely coupled configuration. The architecture foresees autonomous failure detection strategies to avoid divergence in the relative state estimation error caused by unavoidable, unfavorable target observation conditions occurring during the monitoring trajectory. Performance assessment is carried out through numerical simulations realistically reproducing close-range relative motion dynamics and LIDAR sensor operation, and considering targets characterized by highly variable size, shape, and orbital dynamics as test cases.},

Two main components, that include Artificial Intelligence technology, are at the core of ERGO: an on-board mission planner, able to dynamically generate plans on-board from high-level goals, and a scientific agent, that detects targets of interest from images. Additionally, other autonomous capabilities that can be used and tailored for different robotics platforms, such as rover navigation and robotic arm motion planning, are provided by ERGO.

  abstract = {Successful planetary exploration rover missions require high locomotion performance and reliability. However, as experienced by NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, slip-sinkage events can cause complete immobilization. Accurate locomotion performance prediction via extensive soil-wheel interaction data can reduce such risks. Drawbar Pull (DP) vs. slip tests on Single Wheel Testbeds (SWT) are a common empirical means to collect such data. However, the current literature only covers a limited range of environmental conditions and is thus not fully representative. This paper therefore contributes novel methods and data generated with the RUAG Space SWT facility and the ExoMars Phase B2 wheel: First, drawbar pull measurements on ES-3 soil at negative slip are presented. This is important to assess failed and thus dragging wheels as well as downslope trajectories. It also allows interpolating DP values around 0\% slip, which were previously not measurable. Second, a SWT facility that can measure drawbar pull at high slopes is presented. The measurements clearly show that on ES-2, the previous gradability predictions using zeroslope DP data already diverge at {$>$}8\textdegree{} slope. The inclined DP measurements are significantly more accurate. ExoMars BB2 rover tests confirm these findings. Both contributions can be used to increase the prediction accuracy of modern locomotion simulator frameworks.},

According to the specific mission scenario, the pose determination task involves both theoretical and technological challenges related to the search for the most suitable algorithmic solution and sensor architecture, respectively. As regards the latter aspect, electro-optical sensors represent the best option as their use is compatible with mass and power limitation of micro and small satellites, and their measurements can be processed to estimate all the pose parameters. Overall, the degree of complexity of the challenges related to pose determination largely varies depending on the nature of the targets, which may be actively/passively cooperative, uncooperative but known, or uncooperative and unknown space objects. In this respect, while cooperative pose determination has been successfully demonstrated in orbit, the uncooperative case is still under study by universities, research centers, space agencies and private companies. However, in both the cases, the demand for space applications involving relative navigation maneuvers, also in close-proximity, for which pose determination capabilities are mandatory, is significantly increasing. In this framework, a review of state-of-the-art techniques and algorithms developed in the last decades for cooperative and uncooperative pose determination by processing data provided by electrooptical sensors is herein presented. Specifically, their main advantages and drawbacks in terms of achieved performance, computational complexity, and sensitivity to variability of pose and target geometry, are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Distributed systems and Formation Flying mission concepts are becoming increasingly attractive for the space community. Moreover, miniaturization is a growing trend in engineering, which enables small spacecraft to meet challenging requirements by adopting compact components. Three major aspects benefit from the implementation of such mission concepts: flexibility, robustness and cost. Several high-level mission requirements can be achieved in the duration of a single mission thanks to the capability of reconfiguring the formation relative distances and attitudes. Furthermore, having more than one satellite performing the mission increases the robustness of the system, because of the potential replacement of failure points without affecting the rest of the mission. Lastly, standardization of the platforms reduces the cost allowing an easier access to space. For these reasons, formation flying open new possibilities in the field of space engineering, but the low level of maturity of required technologies mission strategies relying on it is slowing down the development. From here stems the need for test campaigns able to rise the technology readiness level of space-unproven hardware and software. In this context, this paper presents the design, characterization and testing of a friction-less facility at the Aerospace Science and Technology Department of Politecnico di Milano for on-ground testing and validation of spacecrafts relative GNC maneuvering.

The estimation of vehicle states and landmarks plays an important role in SLAM. Most of the SLAM algorithms are based on extended Kalman filters (EKFs). However, EKF's are not the best choice for SLAM as they suffer from the assumption of Gaussian noise statistics and linearization errors, which can degrade the performance. H(infinity) filter is one of the alternative of Kalman filter. This paper investigates three SLAM algorithms: (i) EKF SLAM (ii) extended H(infinity)(EH(infinity)) SLAM and (iii) mixed extended H(2)/H(infinity)(EH(2)/H(infinity)) SLAM. A comparison of the three algorithms is given through numerical simulations.},

  address = {{Toulouse}},
  abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to present a vision-based solution to enable autonomous navigation and characterization of an unknown asteroid using a monocular camera during approach.Current approach to asteroid navigation relies on precise radiometric tracking and optical data to reconstruct the relative trajectory with respect to the asteroid. In the next future the radiometric tracking system, the Deep Space Network (DSN), will be overwhelmed as more missions are designed and will be launched to explore the inner Solar System. Autonomous navigation is an envisaged solution to reduce the DSN load as autonomous algorithms would enable the spacecraft to localize itself during all mission phases without ground support.Furthermore, asteroids characteristics are poorly known before arrival as their Earth-based estimation relies on hypothesis on their properties, such as albedo and density. It is thus required to estimate during the mission the asteroid properties which allow precise localization and compelling science.Autonomous navigation can be performed with several sensors but passive cameras are preferred as they are light, compact and low power demanding if compared with other sensors, such as LiDARs. This implies that cameras do not affect the mass and power budgets during the spacecraft design. For these reasons the use of passive cameras in combination with image processing algorithm provides competitive navigation performances with light and cost-effective hardware.During close approach to a small body it is of crucial interest to reconstruct the small body shape and to estimate the small body rotation axis. The former is an important milestone to investigate the gravity field under the assumption of constant density and to allow the use of model-based navigation algorithms. The latter is important to define reference frames and to estimate the small body relative localization.The research of this PhD thesis has been divided in three main sections:1. Firstly, a shape from silhouette algorithm has been developed under the assumption of knowing the relative localization to perform shape reconstruction using limbs information.2. Secondly, an algorithm to both reconstruct the asteroid shape and estimate the rotation axis from images has been developed under the assumption of knowing the scale factor and of having an estimate of the inertial trajectory.3. Finally, the uncertainty quantification on the spherical harmonics arising from a stochastic shape reconstruction has been characterized under the assumption of known constant density.},

  abstract = {The interest of the space community toward missions like On-Orbit Servicing of functional satellite to extend their operative life, or Active Debris Removal to reduce the risk of collision among artificial objects in the most crowded orbital belts, is significantly increasing for both economical and safety aspects. These activities present significant technical challenges and, thus, can be enabled only by increasing the level of autonomy and robustness of space systems in terms of guidance, navigation and control functionalities. Clearly this goal requires the design and development of ad-hoc technologies and algorithms. In this framework, this paper presents an original architecture for relative navigation based on a single passive camera able to fully reconstruct the relative state between a chaser spacecraft and a noncooperative, known target. The proposed architecture is loosely coupled, meaning that pose determination and full relative state estimation are entrusted to separate, but rigidly interconnected processing blocks. Innovative aspects are relevant to both the pose determination algorithms and the filtering scheme. Preliminary performance assessment is carried out by means of numerical simulations considering multiple realistic target/chaser relative dynamics and target geometries. Results allow demonstrating robustness against measurement error sources caused possibly by image processing as well as fast rotational dynamics.},

  abstract = {Autonomous close proximity operations are an arduous and attractive problem in space mission design. In particular, the estimation of pose, motion and inertia properties of an uncooperative object is a challenging task because of the lack of available a priori information. This paper develops a novel method to estimate the relative position, velocity, angular velocity, attitude and the ratios of the components of the inertia matrix of an uncooperative space object using only stereo-vision measurements. The classical Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and an Iterated Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) are used and compared for the estimation procedure. In addition, in order to compute the inertia properties, the ratios of the inertia components are added to the state and a pseudo-measurement equation is considered in the observation model. The relative simplicity of the proposed algorithm could be suitable for an online implementation for real applications. The developed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations in MATLAB using different initial conditions and uncertainty levels. The goal of the simulations is to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed estimation algorithm. The obtained results show satisfactory convergence of estimation errors for all the considered quantities. The obtained results, in several simulations, shows some improvements with respect to similar works, which deal with the same problem, present in literature. In addition, a video processing procedure is presented to reconstruct the geometrical properties of a body using cameras. This inertia reconstruction algorithm has been experimentally validated at the ADAMUS (ADvanced Autonomous MUltiple Spacecraft) Lab at the University of Florida. In the future, this different method could be integrated to the inertia ratios estimator to have a complete tool for mass properties recognition.},

To address this threat, guidelines that include a limited debris release during normal operations, minimization of the potential for on-orbit break-ups and post mission disposal have begun to be implemented. However, for the long-term, the amount of debris will still increase due to fragments created by collisions of objects in space. The active removal of space debris of at least five large objects per years is therefore recommended, but not yet included in those guidelines. Even though various technical concepts have been developed over the last years, the question on how to make them reliable and safe or how to finance such mission has not been answered. This paper addresses the first two topics. With Space Debris representing an uncooperative and possibly tumbling target, close proximity becomes absolutely critical, especially when an uninterrupted connection to the ground station is not ensured. This paper therefore defines firstly a mission to remove at least five large objects and secondly introduces a preliminary autonomy concept fitted for this mission.},

A first concern is then to establish whether different sets of observations belong to the same object, which is the association problem. Due to illumination constraints and adopted observation strategies, small objects may be detected on short arcs, which contain little information about the curvature of the orbit. Thus, a single detection is usually of little value in determining the orbital state due to the very large associated uncertainty. In this work, we propose a method that both recognizes associated observations and sequentially reduces the solution uncertainty when two or more sets of observations are associated. The six-dimensional (6D) association problem is addressed as a cascade of 2D and 4D optimization problems. The performance of the algorithm is assessed using objects in geostationary Earth orbit, with observations spread over short arcs.},

  abstract = {Visual odometry, the process of tracking the trajectory of a moving camera based on its captured video is a fundamental problem behind autonomous mobile robotics and augmented reality applications. Yet, despite almost 40 years of extensive research on the problem, state-of-the-art systems are still vulnerable to several pitfalls that arise in challenging environments due to specific sensor limitations and restrictive assumptions. This thesis, in particular, investigates the use of RGB-D cameras for robust visual odometry in man-made environments, such as industrial plants. These spaces, contrary to natural environments, follow mainly a rectilinear structure made of simple geometric entities. Thus, this work exploits this structure by taking a feature-based approach, where lines, planes and cylinder segments are explicitly extracted as visual cues for egomotion estimation. While the depth captured by RGB-D cameras helps to resolve the ambiguity inherent of passive cameras especially on uniform and low textured surfaces, these active cameras suffer from several limitations, which may deteriorate the performance of RGB-D Odometry, such as, limited operating range, near-infrared light interference and systematic errors, leading to incomplete and noisy depth maps. To address these issues, we have first developed a visual odometry framework that leverages both depth measurements from active sensing and depth estimates from temporal stereo obtained via probabilistic filtering. Our experiments demonstrate that this framework is able to operate on large indoor and outdoor spaces, where the absence and inaccuracy of depth measurements is too high to rely just on RGB-D Odometry. Secondly, this thesis considers the depth sensor error by proposing a depth fusion framework based on Mixture of Gaussians to denoise the depth measurements and model their uncertainties through spatio-temporal observations. Extensive results on RGB-D sequences show that applying this depth model to RGB-D odometry improves significantly its performance and supports our hypothesis that the uncertainty of fused depth needs to be exposed. To fully exploit this probabilistic depth model, the depth uncertainty needs to be propagated throughout the visual odometry pipeline. Therefore, we reformulated the visual odometry system as a probabilistic process by (i) deriving plane and 3D line fitting solutions that model the uncertainties of the feature parameters and (ii) estimating the camera pose by combining different feature-type matches weighted by their respective uncertainties. Lastly, this thesis addresses man-made environments made also of smooth curved surfaces by proposing a curve-aware plane and cylinder extraction algorithm which is shown empirically to be more efficient and accurate than an alternative state-of-the-art plane extraction approach, leading ultimately to better visual odometry performance in scenes made of cylindrical surfaces. To incorporate this feature extractor in visual odometry, the system described above is extended to handle cylinder primitives.},

Depth estimates are generated continuously by a probabilistic depth estimation framework for both types of features to compensate for the lack of depth measurements and inaccurate feature depth associations. The framework models explicitly the uncertainty of triangulating depth from both point and line observations to validate and obtain precise estimates. Furthermore, depth measurements are exploited by propagating them through a depth map registration module and using a frame-to-frame motion estimation method that considers 3Dto-2D and 2D-to-3D reprojection errors, independently. Results on RGB-D sequences captured on large indoor and outdoor scenes, where depth sensor limitations are critical, show that the combination of depth measurements and estimates through our approach is able to overcome the absence and inaccuracy of depth measurements.},

In order to determine when favorable weather and lighting conditions for laser ranging can be expected at any particular site of a network of globally-distributed stations, we compiled daily weather parameters for cloud, wind and visibility from publicly available long-term weather data. For these observing times, synthetic laser ranging measurements are simulated for various types of LEO orbits and subsequently used for precise orbit determination. We derive state vector uncertainties that can be achieved as well as predicted uncertainty when propagating the orbit for a couple of days without any new measurements.},

Our approach is oriented for intelligent vehicle applications, where the separation distance between sensors frames are frequently very important. For this purpose, we use a circle-based calibration object because its geometry allows us to obtain not only an accurate estimation pose by taking advantage of the 3D multi-layer laser range finder perception but also a simultaneous estimation of the pose in the camera frame and the camera intrinsic parameters. These advantages simplify the calibration task in outdoor environments. The method determines the relative position of the sensors by estimating sets of corresponded features and by solving the classical absolute orientation problem. The proposed method is evaluated by using different synthetics environments and real data. An error propagation analysis is made in order to estimate the calibration accuracy and the confidence intervals. Finally, we present a laser data projection into images to validate the consistency of the results.},

Under these conditions, maximum likelihood estimation corresponds to solving a sequence of sparse least-squares minimization problems in which additional summands are added to the objective function over time. In this paper we present Robust Incremental least-Squares Estimation (RISE), an incrementalized version of the Powell's Dog-Leg trust-region method suitable for use in online sparse least-squares minimization. As a trust-region method, Powell's Dog-Leg enjoys excellent global convergence properties, and is known to be considerably faster than both Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt when applied to sparse least-squares problems. Consequently, RISE maintains the speed of current state-of-the-art incremental sparse least-squares methods while providing superior robustness to objective function nonlinearities.},

The main benefit of this choice is that complex dynamic modeling of the mobile robot and its interaction with the environment is avoided. The filter optimally combines the attitude rate information from the gyro and the absolute orientation measurements. The proposed implementation is independent of the structure of the vehicle or the morphology of the ground. The method can easily be transfered to another mobile platform provided it carries an equivalent set of sensors. The 2 0 case is studied in detail first.

We provide an explicit formula for the second-order-optimal nonlinear filter on a general Lie group where optimality is with respect to a deterministic cost measuring the cumulative energy in the unknown system disturbances (minimum-energy filtering). The resulting filter depends on the choice of affine connection which encodes the nonlinear geometry of the state space. As an example, we look at attitude estimation, where we are given a second order mechanical system on the tangent bundle of the special orthogonal group SO(3), namely the rigid body kinematics together with the Euler equation. When we choose the symmetric Cartan-Schouten (0)-connection, the resulting filter has the familiar form of a gradient observer combined with a perturbed matrix Riccati differential equation that updates the filter gain. This example demonstrates how to construct a matrix representation of the abstract general filter formula.},

  abstract = {In many types of space mission there is a constant desire for larger and larger instrument apertures, primarily for the purposes of increased resolution or sensitivity. In the Radio Frequency domain, this is currently addressed by antennas that unfold or deploy on-orbit. However, in the optical and infrared domains, this is a significantly more challenging problem, and has up to now either been addressed by simply having large monolithic mirrors (which are fundamentally limited by the volume and mass lifting capacity of any launch vehicle) or by complex `semifolding' designs such as the James Webb Space Telescope. An alternative is to consider a fractionated instrument which is launched as a collection of individual smaller elements which are then assembled (or self-assemble) once in space, to form a much larger overall instrument. SSTL has been performing early concept assessment work on such systems for high resolution science observations from high orbits (potentially also for persistent surveillance of Earth). A point design of a 25 m sparse aperture (annular ring) telescope is presented. Key characteristics of 1) multiple small elements launched separately and 2) on-orbit assembly to form a larger instrument are included in the architecture. However, on-orbit assembly brings its own challenges in terms of guidance navigation and control, robotics, docking mechanisms, system control and data handling, optical alignment and stability, and many other elements. The number and type of launchers used, and the technologies and systems used heavily affect the outcome and general cost of the telescope. The paper describes one of the fractionated architecture concepts currently being studied by SSTL, including the key technologies and operational concepts that may be possible in the future.},

When the satellites are noncooperative, the problem becomes even more complicated, as there might be poor a priori information about the motion and structure of the target satellite. In this paper, the mentioned problem is solved by using only visual sensors, which measurements are processed through robust filtering algorithms. Using two cameras mounted on a chaser satellite, the relative state with respect to a target satellite, including the position, attitude, and rotational and translational velocities, is estimated. The new approach employs a stereoscopic vision system for tracking a set of feature points on the target spacecraft. The perspective projection of these points on the two cameras constitutes the observation model of an iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) estimation scheme. Using new theoretical results, the information contained in the visual data is quantified using the Fisher information matrix. It is shown that, even in the noncooperative case, there is information that can be extracted pertaining to the relative attitude and target structure. Finally, a method is proposed for rendering the relative motion filtering algorithm robust to uncertainties in the target's inertia tensor. This is accomplished by endowing the IEKF with a maximum a posteriori identification scheme for determining the most probable inertia tensor from several available hypotheses. The performance of the new filtering algorithm is validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. Also a preliminary experimental evaluation is provided.},

This paper addresses these tasks using an observer that measures its own orientation, angular rate, and acceleration, and is equipped with a dense 3D visual sensor, such as a stereo camera or a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor. The observer's trajectory is estimated independently of the target object's rotational motion. Pose-graph mapping is performed using visual odometry to estimate the observer's trajectory in an arbitrary target-fixed frame. In addition to applying pose constraint factors between successive frames, loop closure is performed between temporally non-adjacent frames. A kinematic constraint on the target-fixed frame, resulting from the rigidity of the target object, is exploited to create a novel rotation kinematic factor. This factor connects a trajectory estimation factor graph with the mapping pose graph, and facilitates estimation of the target's center of mass. Map creation is performed by transforming detected feature points into the target-fixed frame, centered at the estimated center of mass. Analysis of the algorithm's computational performance reveals that its computational cost is negligible compared with that of the requisite image processing.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method of obtaining the maximum a posteriori estimate of an inspector satellite's trajectory about an unknown tumbling target while on-orbit. An inspector equipped with radar or a 3D visual sensor (such as LiDAR or stereo cameras), an inertial measurement unit, and a star tracker is used to obtain measurements of range and bearing to the target's centroid, angular velocity, acceleration, and orientation in the inertial frame. A smoothing-based trajectory estimation scheme is presented that makes use of all the input sensor data to estimate the inspector's trajectory. Opensource incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM2) software is used to implement the smoothing-based trajectory estimation algorithm; this facilitates computationally efficient evaluation of the entire trajectory, which can be performed incrementally, and in real time on a computer capable of processing 3D visual sensor data in real time. The presented algorithm was tested on data obtained in 6 degree-of-freedom microgravity using the SPHERES-VERTIGO robotic test platform on the International Space Station (ISS). In these tests, a SPHERES inspector satellite with attached stereo cameras circumnavigated a passive SPHERES target satellite, making visual observations of it. The results of these tests demonstrate accurate estimation of the inspector satellite's trajectory.},

New advances in SLR technologies enable to track and range non-cooperative objects, without retroreflectors, and of different sizes. This new development enables SLR as a cost-efficient alternative tracking system for the entire range of object sizes in the space object catalogue, and obtain precise and high frequency of observations to assist several space operation applications. By providing the orbit refinements prior to conjunctions, to a level that can reduce false alert rates, significantly improves the cost effectiveness of space operations.

A large amount of different algorithms are currently available and have been successfully applied in many groundbased scenarios. Autonomous planetary surface exploration raises additional requirements, like an exceptionally high level of robustness and consistent accuracy throughout the mission, which has to be achieved with the limited computational resources on-board. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive comparative analysis of three landmark-based SLAM algorithms and their applicability to autonomous localisation and mapping for planetary rovers. The algorithms considered are the Extended Kalman Filter, the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter (FastSLAM), and the Extended Information Filter. The analysis includes accuracy, computation time and optimal number of landmarks in simulations using a simplied representative environment. The results suggest the Extended Information Filter to be the most promising technique, with FastSLAM exhibiting several drawbacks especially on long goal-oriented trajectories.},

Many enabling space debris capturing and removal methods have been proposed in the past decade and several methods have been tested on ground and/or in parabolic flight experiments. However, not a single space debris has been removed yet. A space debris object is usually non-cooperative and thus different with targets of onorbit servicing missions. Thus, capturing and removal of space debris is significantly more challenging. One of the greatest challenges is how to reliably capture and remove a non-cooperative target avoiding to generate even more space debris. To motivate this research area and facilitate the development of active space debris removal, this paper provides review and comparison of the existing technologies on active space debris capturing and removal. It also reviews research areas worth investigating under each capturing and removal method. Frameworks of methods for capturing and removing space debris are developed. The advantages and drawbacks of the most relevant capturing and removal methods are addressed as well. In addition, examples and existing projects related to these methods are discussed.},

The Deep-RoK algorithm is a robust Bayesian method, based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), that accounts for both the uncertainty in the weights of the approximated value function and the uncertainty in the transition probabilities, improving the robustness of the agent. We provide theoretical results for our approach and test the proposed algorithms on a continuous state domain.},

One of the most challenging applications is in relation to autonomous planetary exploration using mobile robots. Rovers deployed to explore extraterrestrial surfaces are required to perceive and model the environment with little or no intervention from the ground station. Up to date, stereopsis represents the state-of-the art method and can achieve short-distance planetary surface modelling. However, future space missions will require scene reconstruction at greater distance, fidelity and feature complexity, potentially using other sensors like Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR). LIDAR has been extensively exploited for target detection, identification, and depth estimation in terrestrial robotics, but is still under development to become a viable technology for space robotics. This paper will first review current methods for scene reconstruction and terrain modelling using cameras in planetary robotics and LIDARs in terrestrial robotics; then we will propose camera-LIDAR fusion as a feasible technique to overcome the limitations of either of these individual sensors for planetary exploration. A comprehensive analysis will be presented to demonstrate the advantages of camera-LIDAR fusion in terms of range, fidelity, accuracy and computation.},

This paper attempts to give an understanding and progress of SLAM in autonomous driving industry as well as briefly describes the SLAM techniques that have contributed significantly to the industry, which were especially evaluated on KITTI dataset. We have also attempted to compare various techniques that were presented and made a rough estimate on why the state of the art approach can be revised and refurnished to suit the complex understanding of the environment for effective localization.

The Digital Terrain Model is then incorporated into a bottom-up visual saliency algorithm to augment objects that protrude out of the ground. This Structure Augmented Monocular Saliency algorithm (SAMS) improves the accuracy and reliability of detecting objects in a planetary environment with no training requirements, greater robustness and lower computational complexity than 3D saliency models. Comprehensive analysis of the proposed method is performed using three challenging benchmark datasets.

  abstract = {This paper develops a novel algorithmic framework for autonomous asteroid characterization for the Autonomous Nanosatellite Swarming (ANS) mission concept. There is significant interest in asteroids as evidenced by multiple completed and ongoing asteroid missions. However, these missions heavily rely on human oversight and Earth-based resources such as the NASA Deep Space Network. Such an approach is not sustainable in the long term due to cost and oversubscribed Earth-based resources. Furthermore, these missions typically utilize a single spacecraft that is slow to adapt to its environment due to light time delay and gaps in communication with the Earth. In contrast, ANS comprises multiple small spacecraft that operate autonomously after a brief ground-in-the-loop initialization. The spacecraft are equipped with low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) avionics including star trackers, short-range cameras, radio-frequency intersatellite links, and chip scale atomic clocks. The algorithmic framework developed in this paper utilizes the intersatellite links and images of the asteroid to simultaneously estimate the spacecraft states as well as the asteroid gravity field, shape, and rotational motion. This class of estimation problem is defined in this paper as simultaneous navigation and characterization (SNAC), which is a superset of simultaneous localization and mapping. The ANS SNAC framework consists of three novel modules: 1) multi-agent optical landmark tracking and 3D point reconstruction using stereovision, 2) state estimation through a computationally efficient and robust unscented Kalman filter, and 3) reconstruction of a global spherical harmonic shape model by leveraging a priori knowledge of the shape properties of small celestial bodies. This new framework is validated through the numerical simulation of three spacecraft orbiting the asteroid 433 Eros. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides autonomous and accurate SNAC in a safe manner without any a priori shape model and using only low SWaP-C avionics.},

  abstract = {Docking with potentially tumbling Targets is a common element of many mission architectures, including on-orbit servicing and active debris removal. This paper studies synchronized docking trajectories as a way to ensure the Chaser satellite remains on the docking axis of the tumbling Target, thereby reducing collision risks and enabling persistent onboard sensing of the docking location. Chaser satellites have limited computational power available to them and the time allowed for the determination of a fuel optimal trajectory may be limited. Consequently, parameterized trajectories that approximate the fuel optimal trajectory while following synchronous approaches may be used to provide a computationally efficient means of determining near optimal trajectories to a tumbling Target. This paper presents a method of balancing the computation cost with the added fuel expenditure required for parameterization, including the selection of a parameterization scheme, the number of parameters in the parameterization, and a means of incorporating the dynamics of a tumbling satellite into the parameterization process. Comparisons of the parameterized trajectories are made with the fuel optimal trajectory, which is computed through the numerical propagation of Euler's equations. Additionally, various tumble types are considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the presented computation scheme. With this parameterized trajectory determination method, Chaser satellites may perform terminal approach and docking maneuvers with both fuel and computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {While the most accurate solution to off-line structure from motion (SFM) problems is undoubtedly to extract as much correspondence information as possible and perform global optimisation, sequential methods suitable for live video streams must approximate this to fit within fixed computational bounds. Two quite different approaches to real-time SFM - also called monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) - have proven successful, but they sparsify the problem in different ways. Filtering methods marginalise out past poses and summarise the information gained over time with a probability distribution. Keyframe methods retain the optimisation approach of global bundle adjustment, but computationally must select only a small number of past frames to process. In this paper we perform the first rigorous analysis of the relative advantages of filtering and sparse optimisation for sequential monocular SLAM. A series of experiments in simulation as well using a real image SLAM system were performed by means of covariance propagation and Monte Carlo methods, and comparisons made using a combined cost/accuracy measure. With some well-discussed reservations, we conclude that while filtering may have a niche in systems with low processing resources, in most modern applications keyframe optimisation gives the most accuracy per unit of computing time.},

For a number of reasons, it may be desirable to operate in close proximity to these objects for the purposes of inspection, docking and repair. Many of them have an unknown geometric appearance, are uncooperative and non-communicative. These types of characteristics are also shared by a number of asteroid rendezvous missions. In order to safely operate in close proximity to an object in space, it is important to know the target object's position and orientation relative to the inspector satellite, as well as to build a three-dimensional geometric map of the object for relative navigation in future stages of the mission. This type of problem can be solved with many of the typical Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms that are found in the literature. However, if the target object is spinning with significant angular velocity, it is also important to know the linear and angular velocity of the target object as well as its center of mass, principal axes of inertia and its inertia matrix. This information is essential to being able to propagate the state of the target object to a future time, which is a key capability for any type of proximity operations mission. Most of the typical SLAM algorithms cannot easily provide these types of estimates for high-speed spinning objects.},

The Automation and Robotics Section of the European Space Agency proposed and developed a concept to emulate realistic microgravity and low-gravity in two dimensions by merging the advantage of air-bearing facilities with robotic technology. The Robotic testbed for FloatingDynamics Simulation (ROOTLESS) is based on a holonomic robot on which air bearings are mounted, enabling the payload to float and using a tracking mechanism the the robotic test bed follows the freely floating payload.

Research community has developed numerous SLAM algorithms in the last 10 years. Several works have presented many algorithms' optimizations. However, they have not explored a system optimization from the system hardware architecture to the algorithmic development level. New computing technologies (SIMD coprocessors, DSP, multi-cores) can greatly accelerate the system processing but require rethinking the algorithm implementation. This article presents an efficient implementation of the EKF-SLAM algorithm on a multi-processor architecture. The algorithm-architecture adequacy aims to optimize the implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a low-cost and heterogeneous architecture (implementing an ARM processor with SIMD coprocessor and a DSP core). Experiments were conducted with an instrumented platform. Results aim to demonstrate that an optimized implementation of the algorithm, resulting from an optimization methodology, can help to design embedded systems implementing low-cost multiprocessor architecture operating under real-time constraints.},

  author = {Virdee, Hira Singh},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Human space activity in the past 50 years has led to a plethora of man-made space debris which pose an imminent threat to global space operations. The current models of space debris orbits are not su cient for detailed orbit prediction or for accurate tracking. This uncertainty manifests itself in Conjunction Analysis (CA) with active spacecraft, which leads to excessive orbital manoeuvres which are both expensive and reduce the lifetime of satellites. Advances in orbit modelling will lead to better prediction of debris orbits and reduce the need for collision avoidance manoeuvres, as well as minimising the future pollution of the space environment through collisions. Most existing methods for analysing the orbits of space debris do not take into account the e ects of tumbling, and the attitude-dependent nonconservative forces are generally neglected. This study models the torques and attitude motion of uncontrolled man-made objects in orbit about the Earth, which tumble due to a combination of natural in influences of the near-Earth space environment and initial angular momentum acquired during debris formation. The modelling of space debris is a relatively new field and represents a huge new area of research. The two main branches of this thesis are (a) modelling the torques that induce spin for objects in orbit, and (b) modelling the effect of certain attitude-dependent non-conservative forces on spinning objects in orbit. The main torque modelled in this study is solar radiation pressure (SRP). Simulations of the radiation-induced torques are performed and the main mechanisms that lead to the tumbling of uncontrolled objects are analysed. A novel method of presenting attitude-dependent forces and torques on space objects, dubbed "Torque Maps", is presented. Radiation torques are caused by optical geometric asymmetry and can lead to oscillatory and secular changes in attitude. They are computed for one of the largest objects in orbit: Envisat, a defunct satellite with complex geometry. Further to these, simulations of objects spinning in orbit are used to calculate the effect of tumbling on orbital motion. The results show that the e ects of nonconservative forces on tumbling objects lead to both periodic and secular variations in their orbital elements. This is contrary to previously popular assumption. Additionally, ideas for utilising modern developments in nanosatellite technology for validation of orbit prediction models are presented and calculations of the Lorentz force and its effect for uncontrolled objects are given.},

  abstract = {The relevance of autonomy in space systems during rendezvous and docking operations has been lately increasing. At the scope, a robust GNC architecture is required, which strictly relies on the navigation system's performance and must assure both high efficiency and safety, i.e. low errors and no collisions with the target satellite. One of the most explored fields is the optical navigation one. Using passive optical sensors such as cameras can give high benefit in terms of characterization of the observed scene, thus enlarging the consciousness of what is going on in the mission scenario. The present research investigates the development of a filter which can estimate the shape and relative attitude, position and velocity of a non-cooperative, possibly unknown satellite orbiting around Earth, observed by a camera and a distance sensor mounted on a chaser satellite, whose objective is to successfully complete a docking maneuver. The image taken at a certain time is processed, features are extracted from it and matched with the ones extracted from the image at the previous time step. The matched features along with the relative distance measured by the distance sensor are merged inside an unscented Kalman filter, which predicts, updates and improves the state's estimate throughout the iterations. The expedient used in the filter is to give a 3D characterization to the 2D features used as measurements. The filter estimates the 3D coordinates of these points, i.e. the target's shape, in the camera reference frame, which depend on the target's attitude dynamics and the chaser's relative orbital dynamics. Thus, the target's attitude parameters, i.e. the quaternions, and angular velocity vector, the relative position and velocity vectors and the tracked 3D points are all included in the state vector and estimated by the filter. Subsequently, the 3D point coordinates are determined in the body reference frame. By doing this for all the tracked points, a 3D map of the target can be built.},

The present study deals with on-orbit relative pose and shape estimation with the use of a monocular camera and a distance sensor. The goal is to develop a filter which estimates an observed satellite's relative position, velocity, attitude, and angular velocity, along with its shape, with the measurements obtained by a camera and a distance sensor mounted on board a chaser which is on a relative trajectory around the target. The filter's efficiency is proved with a simulation on a virtual target object. The results of the simulation, even though relevant to a simplified scenario, show that the estimation process is successful and can be considered a promising strategy for a correct and safe docking maneuver.},

Most of existing VO algorithms are developed under a standard pipeline including feature extraction, feature matching, motion estimation, local optimisation, etc. Although some of them have demonstrated superior performance, they usually need to be carefully designed and specifically fine-tuned to work well in different environments. Some prior knowledge is also required to recover an absolute scale for monocular VO. This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for monocular VO by using deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs) 1. Since it is trained and deployed in an end-to-end manner, it infers poses directly from a sequence of raw RGB images (videos) without adopting any module in the conventional VO pipeline. Based on the RCNNs, it not only automatically learns effective feature representation for the VO problem through Convolutional Neural Networks, but also implicitly models sequential dynamics and relations using deep Recurrent Neural Networks. Extensive experiments on the KITTI VO dataset show competitive performance to state-ofthe-art methods, verifying that the end-to-end Deep Learning technique can be a viable complement to the traditional VO systems.},

  abstract = {Loop closure detection plays an important role in reducing localization drift in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). It aims to find repetitive scenes from historical data to reset localization. To tackle the loop closure problem, existing methods often leverage on the matching of visual features, which achieve good accuracy but require high computational resources. However, feature point based methods ignore the patterns of image, i.e., the shape of the objects as well as the distribution of objects in an image. It is believed that this information is usually unique for a scene and can be utilized to improve the performance of traditional loop closure detection methods. In this paper we leverage and compress the information into a binary image to accelerate an existing fast loop closure detection method via binary content. The proposed method can greatly reduce the computational cost without sacrificing recall rate. It consists of three parts: binary content construction, fast image retrieval and precise loop closure detection. No offline training is required. Our method is compared with the state-of-the-art loop closure detection methods and the results show that it outperforms the traditional methods at both recall rate and speed.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to create a new framework for dense SLAM that is light enough for micro-robot systems based on depth camera and inertial sensor. Feature-based and direct methods are two mainstreams in visual SLAM. Both methods minimize photometric or reprojection error by iterative solutions, which are computationally expensive. To overcome this problem, we propose a non-iterative framework to reduce computational requirement. First, the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) and axonometric projection are utilized to decouple the 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) data, so that point clouds can be matched in independent spaces respectively. Second, based on single key-frame training, the matching process is carried out in frequency domain by Fourier transformation, which provides a closed-form non-iterative solution. In this manner, the time complexity is reduced to O(n log n), where n is the number of matched points in each frame. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first non-iterative and online trainable approach for data association in visual SLAM. Compared with the state-of-the-arts, it runs at a faster speed and obtains 3-D maps with higher resolution yet still with comparable accuracy.},

  abstract = {When a space robotic arm deploys a payload, usually the pose between the cooperative target fixed on the payload and the hand-eye camera installed on the arm is calculated in real-time. A high-precision robust visual cooperative target localization method is proposed. Combing a circle, a line and dots as markers, a target that guarantees high detection rates is designed. Given an image, single-pixel-width smooth edges are drawn by a novel linking method. Circles are then quickly extracted using isophotes curvature. Around each circle, a square boundary in a pre-calculated proportion to the circle radius is set. In the boundary, the target is identified if certain numbers of lines exist. Based on the circle, the lines, and the target foreground and background intensities, markers are localized. Finally, the target pose is calculated by the Point-3-Perspective algorithm. The algorithm processes 8 frames per second with the target distance ranging from 0.3m to 1.5 m. It generated highprecision poses of above 97.5\% on over 100,000 images regardless of camera background, target pose, illumination and motion blur. At 0.3 m, the rotation and translation errors were less than 0.015\textdegree{} and 0.2 mm. The proposed algorithm is very suitable for real-time visual measurement that requires high precision in aerospace.},

The General Jacobian Matrix approach describes the motion of the end-effector of an underactuated manipulator system solely by the manipulator joint rotations, with the attitude and position of the base-spacecraft resulting from the manipulator motion. The coupling of the manipulator motion with the base-spacecraft are thus expressed in a generalized inertia matrix and a generalized Jacobian matrix. The focus of the paper lies on the complete analytic derivation of the generalized equations of motion of a free-floating spacecraft-manipulator system. This includes symbolic analytic expressions for all inertia property matrices of the system, including their time derivatives and joint-angle derivatives, as well as an expression for the generalized Jacobian of a generic point on any link of the spacecraft-manipulator system. The kinematics structure of the spacecraft-manipulator system is described both in terms of direction-cosine matrices and unit quaternions. An additional important contribution of this paper is to propose a new and more detailed definition for the modes of maneuvering of a spacecraft-manipulator. In particular, the two commonly used categories free-flying and free-floating are expanded by the introduction of five categories, namely floating, rotation-floating, rotation-flying, translation-flying, and flying. A fully-symbolic and a partially-symbolic option for the implementation of a numerical simulation model based on the proposed analytic approach are introduced and exemplary simulation results for a planar four-link spacecraft-manipulator system and a spatial six-link spacecraft manipulator system are presented.},

This overview paper describes the activities that are currently ongoing at ESA and that have already been completed. Additionally it outlines the plan for the near future. The technologies under study fall in two main categories corresponding to whether a pushing or a pulling manoeuvre is required for the de-orbitation. ESA is studying the option of using a tethered capture system for controlled de-orbitation through pulling where the capture is performed using throw-nets or alternatively a harpoon. The Agency is also studying rigid capture systems with a particular emphasis on tentacles (potentially combined with a robotic arm). Here the de-orbitation is achieved through a push-manoeuvre. Additionally, a number of activities will be discussed that are ongoing to develop supporting technologies for these scenarios, or to develop systems for de-orbiting debris that can be allowed to re-enter in an uncontrolled manner. The shortterm goal and main driver for the current technology developments is to achieve sufficient TRL on required technologies to support a potential de-orbitation mission to remove a large and strategically chosen piece of debris.},

  abstract = {After being launched into space to perform some tasks, the inertia parameters of a space robotic system may change due to fuel consumption, hardware reconfiguration, target capturing, and so on. For precision control and simulation, it is required to identify these parameters on orbit. This paper proposes an effective method for identifying the complete inertia parameters (including the mass, inertia tensor and center of mass position) of a space robotic system. The key to the method is to identify two types of simple dynamics systems: equivalent single-body and two-body systems. For the former, all of the joints are locked into a designed configuration and the thrusters are used for orbital maneuvering. The object function for optimization is defined in terms of acceleration and velocity of the equivalent single body. For the latter, only one joint is unlocked and driven to move along a planned (exiting) trajectory in free-floating mode. The object function is defined based on the linear and angular momentum equations. Then, the parameter identification problems are transformed into non-linear optimization problems. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to determine the optimal parameters, i.e. the complete dynamic parameters of the two equivalent systems. By sequentially unlocking the 1st to nth joints (or unlocking the nth to 1st joints), the mass properties of body 0 to n (or n to 0) are completely identified. For the proposed method, only simple dynamics equations are needed for identification. The excitation motion (orbit maneuvering and joint motion) is also easily realized. Moreover, the method does not require prior knowledge of the mass properties of any body. It is general and practical for identifying a space robotic system on-orbit.},

To perform the servicing mission, the robotic system is firstly required to approach and dock with the target autonomously, for which the measurement of relative pose is the key. It is a challenging task since the existing GEO satellites are generally non-cooperative, i.e. no artificial mark is mounted to aid the measurement. In this paper, a method based on binocular stereo vision is proposed to estimate the pose of a GEO satellite in the final approach phase. It directly takes the natural circular feature on the GEO satellite as the recognized object. Correspondingly, an image processing and pose measurement algorithm is presented to determine the relative position and orientation of the target. This algorithm provides a closed-form solution using simple mathematics, therefore, it is suitable to space applications where the computation capability of the on-board processor is very limited. In addition, it effectively solves the orientation-duality problem for circular feature, requiring neither specific motions of the camera nor a priori knowledge about the radius of the circle. Computer simulations verify the proposed method.},

  title = {{{TESTING SALIENCY BASED TECHNIQUES FOR PLANETARY SURFACE SCENE ANALYSIS}}},
  author = {Yeomans, Brian and Shaukat, Affan and Gao, Yang},
  pages = {7},
  abstract = {Saliency based techniques inspired by biological vision systems offer significant potential advantages over the approaches typically adopted for analysing images gathered from the planetary surface. Using saliency, the algorithms deployed are significantly more computationally efficient as only a subset of the image is processed in depth, and thus they offer the potential for near real time performance, facilitating time critical applications such as hazard detection. Saliency based analysis techniques have however in the main been developed with a focus on terrestrial objects and environments, and so require substantial modification for the relatively monochromatic scenes found on the planetary surface. This paper describes the development and testing of a scene analysis model utilising saliency based techniques which has been optimised for the planetary surface environment. The model has been widely tested using datasets from multiple sources and has been implemented as a hazard detection algorithm as part of the recently completed FASTER FP7 project. The model is shown to achieve rates of computational analysis which are more than adequate for navigation purposes in the context of wheeled planetary exploration; it incorporates equalisation techniques designed to expand the limited colour space seen in the planetary environment context; and uses intensity, colour opponency, shape and orientation-based visual stimuli in a weighted matrix to generate a saliency map; stereo disparity information is then used to locate the salient objects in 3D space. Of note is that despite the limited hue variation in the planetary environment, colour is found still to be an important contributor to the success of the model. The model weighting approach is tuneable, enabling optimisation for a number of specific object types and classes to be achieved, which means that the model can be utilised for many more applications than purely hazard detection, such as improving the computational speed of a feature detection / tracking model using saliency to reduce the scale of the image data to which point based feature detection / tracking, as used for SLAM, is applied. Other applications include data mining of planetary imagery, identifying images of interest appropriate for further detailed study, based on parameters tuned to select the desired feature set of interest.},

Monocular SLAM systems, in contrast, can exploit wide-angle cameras and do not have the depth range limitation, but are unstable for textureless scenes. We present a SLAM system that uses both an RGBD camera and a wide-angle monocular camera for combining the advantages of the two sensors. Our system extracts 3D point features from RGBD frames and 2D point features from monocular frames, which are used to perform both RGBD-to-RGBD and RGBDto-monocular registration. To compensate for different FOV and resolution of the cameras, we generate multiple virtual images for each wide-angle monocular image and use the feature descriptors computed on the virtual images to perform the RGBD-to-monocular matches. To compute the poses of the frames, we construct a graph where nodes represent RGBD and monocular frames and edges denote the pairwise registration results between the nodes. We compute the global poses of the nodes by first finding the minimum spanning trees (MSTs) of the graph and then pruning edges that have inconsistent poses due to possible mismatches using the MST result. We finally run bundle adjustment on the graph using all the consistent edges. Experimental results show that our system registers a larger number of frames than using only an RGBD camera, leading to larger-scale 3D reconstruction.},

  abstract = {There are three main frameworks to describe the orientation and rotation of non-spherical particles: Euler angles, rotation matrices and unit Quaternions. Of these methods, the latter seems the most attractive for describing the behaviour of non-spherical particles. However, there are a number of drawbacks when using unit Quaternions: the necessity of applying rotation matrices in conjunction to facilitate the transformation from body space to world space, and the algorithm integrating the Quaternion should inherently conserve the length of the Quaternion. Both drawbacks are addressed in this paper. The present paper derives a new framework to transform vectors and tensors by unit Quaternions, and the requirement of explicitly using rotation matrices is removed altogether. This means that the algorithm derived in this paper can describe the rotation of a non-spherical particle with four parameters only. Moreover, this paper introduces a novel corrector-predictor method to integrate unit Quaternions, which inherently conserves the length of the Quaternion. The novel framework and method are compared to a number of other methods put forward in the literature. All the integration methods are discussed, scrutinised and compared to each other by comparing the results of four test cases, involving a single falling particle, nine falling and interacting particles, a 2D prescribed torque on a sphere and a 3D prescribed torque on a non-spherical particle. Moreover, a convergence study is presented, comparing the rate of convergence of the various methods. All the test cases show a significant improvement of the new framework put forward in this paper over existing algorithms. Moreover, the new method requires less computational memory and fewer operations, due to the complete omission of the rotation matrix in the algorithm.},

  abstract = {In neural networks, it is often desirable to work with various representations of the same space. For example, 3D rotations can be represented with quaternions or Euler angles. In this paper, we advance a definition of a continuous representation, which can be helpful for training deep neural networks. We relate this to topological concepts such as homeomorphism and embedding. We then investigate what are continuous and discontinuous representations for 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional rotations. We demonstrate that for 3D rotations, all representations are discontinuous in the real Euclidean spaces of four or fewer dimensions. Thus, widely used representations such as quaternions and Euler angles are discontinuous and difficult for neural networks to learn. We show that the 3D rotations have continuous representations in 5D and 6D, which are more suitable for learning. We also present continuous representations for the general case of the n dimensional rotation group SO(n). While our main focus is on rotations, we also show that our constructions apply to other groups such as the orthogonal group and similarity transforms. We finally present empirical results, which show that our continuous rotation representations outperform discontinuous ones for several practical problems in graphics and vision, including a simple autoencoder sanity test, a rotation estimator for 3D point clouds, and an inverse kinematics solver for 3D human poses.},

  abstract = {This work describes a method to estimate shape and pose of a small celestial body with optical measurements, and using only data extracted from the silhouette of the body, together with estimates of the position of the spacecraft from the ground navigation. Silhouettes are preferred to visual landmarks as the latter strongly depend on illumination angles, which vary during the mission. The shape of the small body is represented with a Gaussian Process, which naturally provides a continuous representation of the distance of the surface from the origin of the body and corresponding uncertainty. The proposed method shows promising results, offering an RMSE of approximately 1 \% on the shape of 433 Eros with an initial prior for the shape of a sphere and 1-sigma uncertainties of 6 km, 250 m, 5 degrees, 5 degrees, and 1.7 degrees per hour, on the asteroid radius, asteroid position (in each direction), spin axis declination, ascension, and spin rate respectively.},
